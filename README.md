# BillBuild
Billing system Using the core concept of Oops and C++
Made an Object Oriented Programming based program using the concepts learned, to put together a billing system that has user-based services available, be it for an admin or for a customer. A customer has an option to buy products, or remove and modify them as per their requirements, whereas an admin can alter the available products too.
